# Hi, I’m Ramzbek Kenjayev 👋

## Full-Stack JavaScript / TypeScript Developer

I’m a Full-Stack JavaScript/TypeScript Developer with advanced experience in **Next.js, React, and NestJS**, building production-grade web applications and complex **B2B platforms**. I led the development of **Proliga.uz** and delivered custom **Appsmith-based solutions**, solving critical frontend and backend challenges.

I have strong expertise in modern frontend tooling (**TanStack Query/Table, shadcn/ui, TailwindCSS, Zod**) and backend systems (**Prisma, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Supabase**). My work includes end-to-end security: authentication, bot protection, API rate limiting, and **Nginx-level protections**.

I regularly implement **CI/CD pipelines**, **Docker-based deployments**, web scraping, and analytics/BI integrations (**Yandex.Metrica, DataLens**) to support scalable, data-driven systems.

I’m comfortable working in **remote and distributed teams** and enjoy solving complex technical problems that require deep understanding of libraries, frameworks, and real-world production constraints.
